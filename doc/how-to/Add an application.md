# Add an application

## Register your application

Your application must be in a directory referenced in your inventory by ```app_paths```.  
You can create several folder depending on your needs.

**For example**:

```yaml
# platform/inventory/sample/group_vars/gateway/app_installer.yaml

...

app_paths:
  - "{{ playbook_dir }}/../../apps"
  - "/home/foo/myproject/myapps"        # new directory added
```

Each folder contains a list of applications you will deploy on the platform.

For example: 
```Bash
$ ls -A1 ./apps
elasticsearch
graylog
kafka
```
Hence, you have to create a folder for your app. It will contain all the files and configurations needed to run the app.

> *Note: The application installer process following the alphanumerical order. You can sort your applications prefixing each one by a number with a dash.*  
> *Note: The prefix added will not appear in the application name when deployed. Its only purpose is to allow you to organize your deployments.* 
*Example: 10-linkerd2*

## Configure your application

The app_installer role exploit [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) to deploy your applications.

Each application folder must contains a ```kustomization.yaml``` file.
Each resource defined must include the label ```app.kubernetes.io/instance: YOUR_APP_NAME```.

You can use the instruction ```commonLabels``` to add labels simultaneously on all the resources.

```yaml
commonLabels:
  ...
  app.kubernetes.io/instance: MY_APP_NAME
  app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: Kustomize
```
